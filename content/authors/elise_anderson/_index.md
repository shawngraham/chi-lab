I am a Carleton Honours History Major and Computer Science Minor student with experience in historical research and writing code. I am interested in modding video games to express 'good history', whatever that may be! I was recently an intern as part of a co-op experience with an international development research centre in Ottawa, using and developing social media to promote the work of the research centre.
