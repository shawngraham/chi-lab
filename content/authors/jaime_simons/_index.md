Jaime is a first-year M.A. student in Public History, specializing in Digital Humanities. Their research interests focus on using virtual and augmented reality to increase accessibility for archaeological and historical sites. They also have over seven years of museum experience with a variety of museums.

Their work on the NanoHistory project will examine using the NanoHistory 'cultural network building environment' to represent moments in the recent history of the illegal antiquities trade.
