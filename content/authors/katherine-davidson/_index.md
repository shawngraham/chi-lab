I received my BAH in Archaeology, specializing in Anthropological Archaeology with a Minor in History from Trent University in 2016. I also hold a Master of Arts in Anthropology, specializing in Archaeology, from the University of New Brunswick. My Master's thesis is titled "Washeo Whiskiheggan: Examining the Hudson's Bay Company Fur Trade Post in Fort Severn, Ontario Through Archaeological Analysis and Community Engagement". I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Carleton University.

My research interests are all about using collaborative methodologies to study how people relate to the past - to artifacts, to archaeological site and to the narratives that surround them. My doctoral research uses artifact-centered object-elicitation to talk about memory and identity with Indigenous communities in Northern Ontario. With The BoneTrade Project, I am investigating whether visual similarity in images can be used to trace influence within illicit trade networks on Instagram.
