'Dr. Evans' projects have always focused on what people can and are doing to counter the spread of hateful ideas. In recent years, much of her time has spent analyzing the role of social media as a series of platforms where people might raise consciousness, hone organizational skills, acquire and spread knowledge and come together in virtual, and later in real communities, to voice outrage and opposition to these groups. She maintains that “the symbols people choose to help make their point, the rhetoric, the appeal to history—all these cultural iconographies are important pieces of the puzzle, and they need to be interrogated critically.”'  [Excerpted from 'The Fog of Our New Political Reality'](https://carleton.ca/fass/studying-history-take-new-fascism-prof-jennifer-evans/)
